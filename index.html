          Ozone layer saves us from the UV rays produced by the sun. <br>If we deplete it the Ultraviolet rays produced from the sun leads us to many diseases and allergies. So we should save ozone

      <h2>What is Ozone Layer</h2>
      <p>The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of Earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. It contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere, although still small in relation to other gases in the stratosphere. The ozone layer contains less than 10 parts per million of ozone, while the average ozone concentration in Earth's atmosphere as a whole is about 0.3 parts per million. The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometers (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically.It is scientifically called O3 as it contains small mollicules of  oxygen.</p>

      <h3>Ozone Enemies</h3>
      <p>Ozone layer is also damaged by smoke realised by Factories, vehicles and ForestFires caused due to humans!!</p>

      <h1>How we can Protect our Ozone Layer !!</h1>
      <br><br>
      <ul id="save-ozone">
          Avoid the consumption of gases dangerous to the ozone layer, due to their content or manufacturing process. <br><br>
      Minimize the use of cars. <br><br>
      Do not use cleaning products that are harmful to the environment and to us. <br><br>
      Buy local products. <br><br>
      For travelling short distances use cycles or walk. <br><br>
      Purify smoke from factories before releasing them. <br><br>
      Use vehicles with CNG Engine. <br><br>
